intermediate versions:
think about the simpelest version of this project, and build from there:




- divide the JS file into the following categories:
	- variable declarations
		* node declarations
		* other global variables
	- functions
		* utility functions
		* controller functions
	- DOM generation
		- node creation
		- listeners
--------------------------------------------------

paste versions in bold, and think about which steps to take for each function.
only work out the first version completely, and only write 2 - 3 steps max for future versions
